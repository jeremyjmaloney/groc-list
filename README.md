# DESCRIPTION

- GROS-LIST is a MERN stack grocery/item list application. I wanted to create an alternative to writing a list down on a piece of paper and taking a picture of it on your phone. The app was designed for mobile first and is easy to use.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

- MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, React Router, Node.js, and axios.
- Deployed on: Heroku.

# WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?

- Create any type of list you want!
- Add any number of new items you want.
- Each item has a name and a level of priority (low = green, high = red).
- You can edit the name of the item, the priority level, click on 'GOT IT' and cross it off the list, or delete the item from the list.
- When you're all done with the list you can delete the entire list and start another one the next time you need it! Simple!

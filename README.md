# DESCRIPTION

- GROS-LIST is a MERN stack grocery/item list application. I wanted to create an alternative to writing a list down on a piece of paper and taking a picture of it on your phone. The app was designed for mobile first and is easy to use.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

- MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and axios.
- Deployed on: Heroku.
